About the times:

Source: Witch Queens, Voodoo Spirits and Hoodoo Saints by Denise Alvarado
- Catholicism was intermingled with Voodou spirits and saints
- White men arranged common-law households with non-European women of African, Native American, and Creole 
descent. There were economic benefits to these arrangements, including freedom for enslaved family members.
- No white women were known to work the docks
- There was a Voudou dance called bamboula
- At the time, women of color were forced to wear a law-enforced tignon 
- A gris gris is a Voudou charm, a powerful hallmark of Voudou Magick, used to bring love
- For the gris gris, Balm of Gilead was used for emotional comfort, red rose petals for love, lotus root 
for spiritual protection, rosemary for a woman's worth, a High John root for all around success, a fixed 
acorn for good luck in gambling 
- A gris gris was often blessed three times (father, son, holy spirit)
- Sacred serpent can be called down, Li Grand Zombi, into a gris gris 
- Floating bordello: houseboat turned brothel, run by a Madame
- Follow Me Boy perfume: A houdoun recipe dating back almost 150 years. This blend is favored by prostitutes,
exotic dancers and others in the sex industry for its power to attract, seduce, and enthrall. Ensures financial
gain and increased profits.
- Damballah Wedo: most important of all loa (spirits), the primordial creator; 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damballa

Notable Sayings:
- Gifted with the far eye: a person who could see spirits, tell the future, and has "second sight"
- "worth no more than a dead skunk's bounty"
- A "fixed" item has been ritually prepared for a purpose (i.e. a fixed acorn for good luck in gambling)
- "Ashe', Ashe', Ashe'" means power, commandment, and authority, the ability to make whatever one says happen 
from the spiritual to the physical realm. Example use: after blessing an object or person.
- "Ballin' the Jack" means going fast and energetically, especially of railroad trains; having a riotously 
good time, especially by vigorous dancing; copulating; risking everything on a single throw of a dice.


Known Spirits:

Annie Christmas:
- Worked into Voodou pantheon of spirits in pre-civil war times
- Reported to have been a real woman who worked the docks, who was stronger than most men, who could drink 
men under the table, and who rejected racist social expectations and conventions of the times
- Annie is petitioned for protection and defense, mothering the weak and poor, healing the sick, removing 
obstacles, empowering women, and destroying 
bullies
- "As strong as Annie Christmas" is a saying
- She did not wear the law-enforced tignon
- Her name was honored on St. John's Eve by the Pope of Voudou, Marie Laveau (considered the black goddess 
of the Motherland)
- She may have settled upriver near a bayou at Natchez Trace
