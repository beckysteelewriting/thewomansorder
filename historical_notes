About the times:

Source: Witch Queens, Voodoo Spirits and Hoodoo Saints by Denise Alvarado
- Catholicism was intermingled with Voodou spirits and saints
- White men arranged common-law households with non-European women of African, Native American, and Creole 
descent. There were economic benefits to these arrangements, including freedom for enslaved family members.
- No white women were known to work the docks
- There was a Voudou dance called bamboula
- At the time, women of color were forced to wear a law-enforced tignon 
- A gris gris is a Voudou charm, a powerful hallmark of Voudou Magick, used to bring love
- For the gris gris, Balm of Gilead was used for emotional comfort, red rose petals for love, lotus root 
for spiritual protection, rosemary for a woman's worth, a High John root for all around success, a fixed 
acorn for good luck in gambling 

Notable Sayings:
- Gifted with the far eye: a person who could see spirits, tell the future, and has "second sight"
- "worth no more than a dead skunk's bounty"
- A "fixed" item has been ritually prepared for a purpose (i.e. a fixed acorn for good luck in gambling)

Known Spirits:

Annie Christmas:
- Worked into Voodou pantheon of spirits in pre-civil war times
- Reported to have been a real woman who worked the docks, who was stronger than most men, who could drink 
men under the table, and who rejected racist social expectations and conventions of the times
- Annie is petitioned for protection and defense, mothering the weak and poor, healing the sick, removing 
obstacles, empowering women, and destroying 
bullies
- "As strong as Annie Christmas" is a saying
- She did not wear the law-enforced tignon
- Her name was honored on St. John's Eve by the Pope of Voudou, Marie Laveau (considered the black goddess 
of the Motherland)
